    <h3>1. Creating a Web Page</h3>

    This page was typed by hand.  Anybody can do this, you don't need any
    special "web creation" tools or HTML editors, and the pages you make can be
    viewed from any browser.  To see how this page was made, choose
    <b>View Source</b> (or View Page Source, or View Document Source) in your
    browser's menu (or &mdash; in at least Chrome and Firefox &mdash; Ctrl-U on
    your keyboard).  A simple web page like this one is just plain text with
    HTML commands (markup) mixed in.  HTML commands (properly called "tags")
    themselves are plain text.

    <h3 id="syntax">2. HTML Syntax</h3>
    Web pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).  HTML has three
    special characters:
    <span class="tt">&lt;</span>, <span class="tt">&amp;</span>, <span class="tt">&gt;</span>.
    An HTML command is enclosed in <span class="tt">&lt;...&gt;</span>, for example 
    <span class="tt">&lt;p&gt;</span>, which is a paragraph separator, or <span class="tt">&lt;b&gt;</span>
    ("begin bold") and <span class="tt">&lt;/b&gt;</span> ("end bold").  So the following
    HTML text:

    <div style="overflow-x:auto">
    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    This sentence contains &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </div>

    produces:

    <p>
    <div style="overflow-x:auto">
    <blockquote>
    This sentence contains <b>bold</b> text.
    </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>

    A Web page starts with a series of HTML commands, and ends with
    a few more.  The contents go in between:

    <p>
    <div style="overflow-x:auto">
    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;META charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;META name="viewport"
     content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sample Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
    <i>(Contents go here)</i>
    <p>
    <pre>
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>

    The first line (<span class="tt">DOCTYPE</span>) specifies which markup
    language the page uses
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> = Hypertext Markup
    Language); just copy this line.  The next
    line, <span class="tt">&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;</span>, starts the page
    and specifies
    the (human) language it is written in (language codes are specified
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">here</a>),
    and is matched by the line 
    <span class="tt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>, which closes the
    page.  <span class="tt">&lt;head&gt;</span> starts the heading, which
    contains a title to be displayed on the browser's title bar and a
    declaration of the character set (nowadays it should always be
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>) and the "viewport"
    line which is a compulsory adaptation for cell phones, "smart" watches, etc.
    <span class="tt">&lt;/head&gt;</span> closes the heading.  The head can also
    contain other items such as style parameters that you can learn about later;
    for example by asking Google ("HTML how do&nbsp;I change the font size?").
      
    <p>

    The <span class="tt">&lt;body&gt;</span> tag starts the body of the
    document, is closed by <span class="tt">&lt;/body&gt;</span> tag.

    <p>

    As you can see, most HTML commands come in begin-end pairs:
    <span class="tt">&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</span>,
    <span class="tt">&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</span>, etc.  The closing part of the command
    has a slash (<span class="tt">/</span>) between the <span class="tt">&lt;</span> and the first letter of
    the command.

    <p>

    Blank lines and line breaks are ignored.  The browser automatically "flows"
    your text into lines and paragraphs that fit in its window.  Paragraphs must
    be separated by <span class="tt">&lt;p&gt;</span>.  Line breaks can be
    forced by <span class="tt">&lt;br&gt;</span>.
  </body>
